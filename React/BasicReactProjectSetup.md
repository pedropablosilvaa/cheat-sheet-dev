# Starting a React Project

## Step 1: Create a New React Application

First, you'll need to set up a new React application using Create React App. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-application
```

This will create a new directory called `my-application` with all the necessary files and dependencies to start your React project.

## Step 2: Navigate into Your Project Directory

Change into your project directory:

```bash
cd my-application
```

## Step 3: Start the Development Server

To start the development server and see your new React app in action, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will open up a browser window with your React application running on localhost.

## Step 4: Install React Router

React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps UI in sync with the URL.

Install React Router by running:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom@6
```

## Step 5: Setup React Router

In your project, you can set up basic routing by modifying the `App.js` file:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import HomePage from './HomePage';
import AboutPage from './AboutPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Replace `HomePage` and `AboutPage` with your actual component files.

## Step 6: Implement React Context API

The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.

### Create a Context

First, create a new context:

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react';

// Prepare the DataContext
const DataContext = createContext();

// Component that provides the data context
export function DataProvider({ reducer, initialState, children }) {
  return (
    <DataContext.Provider value={useReducer(reducer, initialState)}>
      {children}
    </DataContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Hook to use the data context
export const useData = () => useContext(DataContext);
```

### Use Context in Your Components

You can now use this context in your components to access or modify the state:

```jsx
import { useData } from './DataContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const [{ user }, dispatch] = useData();

  // You can now access the user state and dispatch actions
}
```

This setup gives you a basic project structure using React, React Router, and the Context API.
